Generate a realistic task title and description for a {{project_type}} project
in a B2B SaaS company using Asana.

Guidelines:
- Use clear, action-oriented language
- Avoid repetition across tasks
- Vary the level of detail (some short, some detailed)
- Follow a professional enterprise tone
- Ensure the task sounds suitable for product development, marketing, or operations work

Examples:
- "Refactor authentication service to improve response time"
- "Prepare Q3 product launch email campaign"
- "Audit vendor invoices for compliance"
